## Hi! I'm Rochelle

Welcome to my profile! I'm an MSc student in Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) at Imperial College London. Here, I upload everything that’s not available on my official ESE account.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on updating my moment tensor summation code using the IntPyGMT library I recently developed.
- 🌱 You can check out my official ESE account at https://github.com/esemsc-rp1321.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to earthquakes and tectonics!
- 📫 How to reach me: rochelle.pun@gmail.com
- 🪨 Fun fact: My name Rochelle means "little rock" in French, and I do indeed love rocks!
