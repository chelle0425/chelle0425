# Hi I'm Rochelle ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I'm a third-year Geophysics student at Imperial College London passionate about applying complex data analysis to subsurface imaging that drives the energy transition. This is the place where I upload all of my code, from independent research projects to lecture notes!

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on making my moment tensor summation code as user-friendly and accessible as possible
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently teaching myself DSML techniques in preparation for my MSc in Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a summer industry internship in subsurface imaging (both geophysical and with a DSML focus)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to rocks and tectonics!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: rochelle.pun@gmail.com
- ðŸª¨ Fun fact: My name Rochelle means "little rock" in French, and I do indeed love rocks!
